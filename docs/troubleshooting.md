# Troubleshooting

Here is a list of problems that may arise, as well as solutions to those problems

---

> Nothing seems to be working
> - tutorials don't appear when starting
> - none of the buttons can be clicked.

This may have happen directly after installing a new version of the app. To fix:
1. Uninstall the app from your headset <br> *make sure to uninstall first. This will remove some lingering files that are causing the problem*
2. Install the latest version

> Can't find a saved project

Go to app.embodiedcode.net/profile and check your projects. If it doesn't appear there, it may be saved under someone else's account, or it wasn't saved.

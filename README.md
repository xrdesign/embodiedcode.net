# Exploring Virtual Reality and Embodied Computational Reasoning
__A workshop for ICER 2021 ([link](https://icer2021.acm.org/info/co-located-workshops))__

Date: Saturday, August 14, 11:00AM - 1PM PDT

The increasing sophistication and availability of Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) 
technologies wield the potential to transform how we teach and learn computational concepts and 
coding. This workshop examines how AR/VR can be leveraged in computer science (CS) 
education within the context of embodied learning. It has been theorized that abstract 
computational concepts, such as data, operators, and loops, are grounded in embodied 
representations that arise from our sensorimotor experience of the physical world. For instance, 
researchers have shown that when CS students describe algorithms, conditionals, and other 
computational structures, they frequently gesture in ways that suggest they are conceptualizing 
interactions with tangible objects. Can learning to code become a more intuitive process if lessons 
take into account these types of embodied conceptual phenomena? This two-hour workshop 
explores 1) theories of embodiment and 2) new and existing tools and practices that support 
embodied CS learning – ranging from Papert’s LOGO turtles to a preview of an innovative 3D 
spatial coding platform for AR/VR under development by our group. Other open-source and 
commercially available resources will also be examined through streamed video demos and a 
hands-on break-out session for participants with VR headsets.

We are soliciting participation in a set of VR-facilitated design activities and field studies from March 22-26 to support XR/AR projects at the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience, the [Arthur C. Clarke Center for Human Imagination](https://imagination.ucsd.edu), and the [Human-Centered and Ubiquitous Computing Lab](https://ubicomp.ucsd.edu/).

Participating students will have access to a Quest 2 for the week of Spring Break. Through design activities (10-15 minutes each) offered remotely (e.g. in their residence), students will contribute to the design of a programming platform in 3D space and of assistive health care technologies. Participant responses and performance will inform the development of our platforms. 

We will conduct Zoom-led focus groups/check-in meetings during the week and introduce VR worldbuilding methods.

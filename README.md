# XR Design Studies With Oculus Quest 2
__Spring Break Research Experience 2021__

We are soliciting participation in a set of VR-facilitated design activities and field studies from March 22-26 to support XR/AR projects at the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience, the Clarke Center for Human Imagination, and the Human-Centered and Ubiquitous Computing Lab.

Participating students will have access to a Quest 2 for the week of Spring Break. Through design activities (10-15 minutes each) offered remotely (e.g. in their residence), students will contribute to the design of a programming platform in 3D space and of assistive health care technologies. Participant responses and performance will inform the development of our platforms. We will conduct Zoom-led focus groups/check-in meetings during the week and introduce VR worldbuilding methods.
